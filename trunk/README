ALTIVEC-ARCH
============

NOTE: To use this model with ArchC you'll need to apply our patch to ArchC
2.0beta3 tarball, rerun all autotools programs (because we changed a
Makefile.am), recompile and reinstall. (hint: "patch -p1 < file.patch")

Generating and compiling the model (acsim must be on your PATH):

  $ cd model/
  $ make

Running our test suite:

  $ cd t/
  $ make test

After compiling the tests (.bin files) you can run them one by one, using

  $ ../model/powerpc.x --load=xxxx.bin
